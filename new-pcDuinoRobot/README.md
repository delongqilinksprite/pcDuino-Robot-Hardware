## Introduction to pcDuino Robot assembly

### 1.Chassis assembly

* Secure the two servo motors to the chassis with screws
* Secure the wheels to the servo motors with screws
* Secure the caster to the chassis with screws

###### Note:The caster and the two wheels should be at the same heightï¼Œand you need to add shims if necessary.

Use the following pictures to check whether the installation is correct.

### 2.Pallet assembly

* Use three copper studs to attach the pcDuino3B to the pallet
* The Ultrasonic Sensor has been installed on the bracket, so you just need to secure the two ultrasonic brackets to the pallet
* Stick the label to a free position of the pallet

###### Note: The two ultrasonic sensors should be placed at the front and right respectively.

Check whether the installation is correct according to the following pictures.

### Complete Robot assembly

* Use two screws to secure the chassis and the pallet together.

###### Note that the caster points to the front.

* Secure the battery to the caster side with a cable tie as the following picture

* Secure the charging port of the battery to the pallet with a cable tie

### Wiring

* Connect the Power Base Shield to the pcDuino3B

* Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Power Base Shield according to the following tables

Use the following pictures to check your wiring.

| Ultrasonic Front | Power Base Shield |
| ---------------- | -----------------:|
| VCC              | VCC               |
| Trig             | D13               |
| Echo             | D3                |
| GND              | GND               |

| Ultrasonic Right | Power Base Shield |
| ---------------- | -----------------:|
| VCC              | VCC               |
| Trig             | D12               |
| Echo             | D2                |
| GND              | GND               |

* Connect the servo motors to the Power Base Shield according to the following tables

| Servo Left      | Power Base Shield |
| ---------------- | -----------------:|
| Black            | GND               |
| Red              | Servo5V           |
| White            | D11               |

| Servo Right       | Power Base Shield |
| ---------------- | -----------------:|
| Black            | GND               |
| Red              | Servo5V           |
| White            | D10               |

* Connect the battery power output to the Power Base Shield power input

Use the following pictures to check your wiring.
